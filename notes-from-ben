Backend vs. frontend validation

Backend 
 - Contraints.  Gatekeeper.  Things you are enforcing as a rule, absolutes, cannot be's, you can guarantee security and rejection of malformed or hostile or manipulative requests.

Frontend
 - Convenience to the user.  Remember that the checks can be circumvented.

For Backend Auth:
 - Use middleware to check for admin or not.
 - Test each admin route to make sure it actually requires an admin permission.
 - don't put default objects in store...return an empty object.  Then test for it, and use a loading component.  The most elegant way is to make a higher order component that has.
